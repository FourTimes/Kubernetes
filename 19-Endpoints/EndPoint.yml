# You might notice there are no Pod selectors for this service. 
# This creates a service, but it doesnâ€™t know where to send the traffic. 
# This allows you to manually create an Endpoints object that will receive traffic from this service.

# You can see that the Endpoints manually defines the IP address for the database, and it uses the same name as the service. 
# Kubernetes uses all the IP addresses defined in the Endpoints as if they were regular Kubernetes Pods.
